- Look into better automatic dust removal usin IR layer.
- UI refinements (I'm backend guy, i don't know what I'm doing)
- Filmstock crosstalk preset support.
- E-6 Mode for editing slide scans.
- Look into GPU Acceleration? Current processing is highly optimized but using GPU for some calculation should be even faster.
- Algorithm fine-tuning.
