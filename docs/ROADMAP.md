# Roadmap

1. Metadata editor (save filmstock, developer, scanning etc.)
2. Keyboard shortucts.
3. Filmstock crosstalk preset support.
4. UI refinements (I'm backend guy, i don't know what I'm doing)
5. Look into GPU Acceleration? Current processing is highly optimized but using GPU for some calculation should be even faster.
6. Whatever comes to mind next.
