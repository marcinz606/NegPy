1. Metadata editor (save filmstock, developer, scanning etc.)
2. Keyboard shortucts.
3. Look into better automatic dust removal usin IR layer.
3. UI refinements (I'm backend guy, i don't know what I'm doing)
4. Filmstock crosstalk preset support.
5. Look into GPU Acceleration? Current processing is highly optimized but using GPU for some calculation should be even faster.
6. Whatever comes to mind next.
